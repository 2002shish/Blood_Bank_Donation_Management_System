The "Blood Bank Donation System" is a comprehensive web-based application developed using PHP, designed to facilitate the process of managing blood donation activities and maintaining the records of donors, recipients, and inventory in a blood bank. This system provides two distinct interfaces: one for the administrators and another for the users/donors.![image](https://github.com/2002shish/Blood_Bank_Donation_Management_System/assets/81770924/18b6c77c-9930-4c8e-a4bb-a541ce48f74d)
